//think of way to monitor not only api call function but process execution and include timer for execution of such processes
// also could include Error handling and log errors for monitoring
// last thing to implement 
// integrate db
// clean up db and normalize
// create middleware api key integration 
// implement this on internal app
//update endpoints names to specify api and psudo process type // http://localhost:3000/api/shipment/insert_shipment

//also use chat gpt to refactor code and add comments to cleary explain code as well as clean it up
